# Types

The most important part of the data management capabilities provided by numbani-react, come from the various data types allowed.

This is important because, for each data types : 
 - Persistence provider automatically handles saving and reading on the backend;
 - [React Values](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/react-values) helpers are provided;
 - UI Components are provided for displaying and editing;

## Type inheritance

There are 5 basics data types, from which others data types can inherit. Persistence provider and UI components *should at least support basics types*, and could have more specialized treatment for advanced types.

Basics types actually corresponds to primitive Javascript data types, plus some built-in objects.

Every types accepts `null` or `undefined` unless `required()` is called on the Type object.

1. Number
2. Boolean
3. String
4. Date
5. Array
