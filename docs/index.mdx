# Getting started

Numbani-React is a library for fast prototyping.

It is primarily made to be used for building a PoC or MVP.

It can still be an helpful toolbox in the final product.

We take advantage of existing tools (Firebase as back end, Bootstrap for UI...) and gather most of the things
you will need to build a web platform in one place.

*So far we have only implemented Firebase as back end and Bootstrap for UI, we are hoping to add more options in a near future.*

Here is a list of use case the library covers :

- User authentication (really easy to set up using Firebase authentication for example)
- Data management (for example using Firestore you can CRUD your data easily, also support polling and advanced queries )
- Data validation ( ready to use data validation, example, define an attribute like user.name as required )
- UI Kit ( the library provide ui component to edit many data type and simplify form design by leveraging React Context)
- All this work out the box, nearly zero config !
