# Getting started

[![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm] [![Coveralls][coveralls-badge]][coveralls] [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/numbani/numbani-react.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://GitHub.com/numbani/numbani-react/stargazers/)


## About

Numbani-React is a library for fast ðŸŒ  web apps prototyping.

See it as a toolbox to build simple web apps with React without coding basic stuff again.

The library provide React components for many goals : Login, Display Data, Edit Data, Start Task, Monitor Progress etc...

It try to gather **most of the things** you will need in **one place** with **zero config**.

*You also don't have to worry about bundle size, you only import what you use.*

I started this project as a way to provide *reusable React logic* that I find myself always rewriting each time I was building an **MVP** or **PoC** at hackathons for example.
I think there is not a lot of libraries like this because there is no (and there should not be) standard way to manage things like data loading, async validation, or authentication in React.
However, there is clearly a set of best pratices that have been emerging on React's documentation, especially after React v16.4 update.
What I am trying to do here is to encapsulate those best pratices in a ready to use library, and update them as my understanting of React grow. At least, it helps me build things faster while learning more about React.
And even if it was built with PoC or MVP in mind, the abstraction numbani-react offers can still be useful in final product.

**Demo** : (TODO) list of web apps built entirely with numbani-react and how long it took to build them.

## Installation


```shell

npm i numbani-react

``` 

or 

```shell

yarn add numbani-react

```

## Usage

Here is a list of functionalities this library provide :

**Authentication**

<Link to="/auth-firebase">Authentication with Firebase</Link>

(Works out of the box with Firebase Firestore, Local Storage... and can be extended to any backend) :

- <Link to="/data-concepts">Data management</Link>

- <Link to="/data-display-entity">Load and display data</Link>

- <Link to="/data-edit-entity">Edit, validate and save data</Link>

## One last thing
