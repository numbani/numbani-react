## About

Numbani-React is a library for fast ðŸŒ  web apps prototyping (think MVP or PoC).

It try to gather **most of the things** you will need in **one place** with **zero config**.

*Do not worry about bundle size, if you use webpack as bundler you can still import only what you need.*

Even if built with PoC or MVP in mind, the abstraction numbani-react offers can still be useful in final product.

**Demo** : (TODO) list of web apps built entirely with numbani-react and how long it took to build them.

## Installation


```shell

npm i numbani-react

``` 

or 

```shell

yarn add numbani-react

```

## Usage

The library provide you **user centric** components. Each components available match an **user intent** : Login, Display Data, Edit Data, Monitor Progress, Start Task ...

Using numbani-react to build your web apps means :

1. Define what end users can do on your web app
2. Find if there is a component in the library to implement it (stay generic)
3. Profit ðŸ˜…

Here is a list of intent categories the library covers (some of these are not ready yet):

- <Link to="/docs-auth-firebase">Authentication</Link> (Login, Logout, Get user info, Edit user info...)
- Data (Display data, Sync data, Queries, Edit data...)
- Task (Start task, Monitor Progress, Cancel Task ...)
- All this work out the box, nearly zero config !

Here is what is not included in this library, cause it is simpler to use them outside :

- Routing, check [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) instead
- Localization, check *i18next* or *react-intl*
- Raw UI component (for example Button), check *Bootstrap*, *Material UI*...

## Backend

Web apps need a Backend to allow functionality like Authentication. We have provided integration for **Firebase** as Backend, but you can also implement yours.

## Frontend UI lib

To make our intents components we use internally *Bootstrap 4 and Reactstrap*. And soon you could choose *Material UI* instead. But you can also implement yours.

## One last thing

We take advantage of existing tools, and inspired by *Create-react-app*, our philosophy is to pick the best known option (or one of the best if there is many) so you are ready to go. But we also don't want to lock you in, so it is actually easy to replace anything.

It is open source and contributions are welcome, if you think we are doing something wrong tell us !
