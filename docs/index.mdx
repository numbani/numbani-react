# Getting started

[![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm] [![Coveralls][coveralls-badge]][coveralls] [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/numbani/numbani-react.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://GitHub.com/numbani/numbani-react/stargazers/)


## About

Numbani-React is a library for fast ðŸŒ  web apps prototyping (think MVP or PoC).

See it as a toolbox to build web apps with React without coding basic stuff again.

The library provide React components for many goals : Login, Display Data, Edit Data, Start Task, Monitor Progress etc...

It try to gather **most of the things** you will need in **one place** with **zero config**.

*You also don't have to worry about bundle size, you only import only what you need.*

I started this project as a way to provide *reusable logic* that I find myself always rewriting in React.

I don't know, but I think there is not out there a lot of libraries like this because there is no (and there should not be) standard way to manage thing like data loading, async validation, or authentication in React.

However, there is clearly a set of best pratices that have been emerging on React's documentation, especially after version 16.4. 

What I am trying to do here is to encapsulate those best pratices in a ready to use library, and update them as my understanting of React grow. At least, it helps me build things faster and learn more about React. I hope it could help more people.

And even if it was built with PoC or MVP in mind, the abstraction numbani-react offers can still be useful in final product.

**Demo** : (TODO) list of web apps built entirely with numbani-react and how long it took to build them.

## Installation


```shell

npm i numbani-react

```
