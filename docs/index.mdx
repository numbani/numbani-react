## About

Numbani-React is a library for fast ðŸŒ  web apps prototyping (think MVP or PoC).

See it as a toolbox to build web apps with React without coding basic stuff again.

The library provide React components for many goals : Login, Display Data, Edit Data, Start Task, Monitor Progress etc...

It try to gather **most of the things** you will need in **one place** with **zero config**.

*Do not worry about bundle size, if you use webpack as bundler you can still import only what you need.*

Even if built with PoC or MVP in mind, the abstraction numbani-react offers can still be useful in final product.

**Demo** : (TODO) list of web apps built entirely with numbani-react and how long it took to build them.

## Installation


```shell

npm i numbani-react

``` 

or 

```shell

yarn add numbani-react

```

## Usage

Using numbani-react to build your web apps means :

1. Define what end users can do on your web app
2. Find if there is a component in the library to implement it (stay generic)
3. Profit ðŸ˜…

Here is a list of functionality this library covers (some of these are not ready yet):

- <Link to="/docs-auth-firebase">Authentication</Link> (Login, Logout, Get user info, Edit user info...)
- Data (Display data, Sync data, Queries, Edit data...)
- Task (Start task, Monitor Progress, Cancel Task ...)
- All this work out the box, nearly zero config !

## Backend

Web apps need a Backend to allow functionality like Authentication. We have provided integration for **Firebase** as Backend, but you can also implement yours.

## Frontend UI lib

To make our components we use internally *Bootstrap 4 and Reactstrap*. And soon you could choose *Material UI* instead. But you can also implement yours.

## One last thing

It is open source and contributions are welcome, if you think we are doing something wrong tell us !
